PLIOBUF-1#1 Error
DRC check between IO and buffer(IBUF/OBUF)  
Inputs of IBUF/BUFGP instance u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk is not driven by port. This might lead to unplaceable/unroutable situation
Related violations: <none>

NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
1 out of 4 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: reset.
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
1 out of 4 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: reset.
Related violations: <none>

AVAL-100#1 Warning
v7_selectio_diff_term_rule1  
The I/O buffer u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_clk_ibuf/diff_input_clk.u_ibufg_sys_clk has an invalid DIFF_TERM property value.  For the target architecture, IOSTANDARD value %STR does not support on-chip input differential termination.  The DIFF_TERM property value will be ignored.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
