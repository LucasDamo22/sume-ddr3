PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net next_state_reg[3]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin next_state_reg[3]_i_2/O, cell next_state_reg[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-23#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_iodelay_ctrl/diff_clk_ref.u_ibufg_clk_ref (IBUFDS.O) is locked to H19
	u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_iodelay_ctrl/clk_ref_mmcm_gen.mmcm_i (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X0Y4

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of u_mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
Related violations: <none>
